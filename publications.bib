In CSIDH, an isogeny-based post-quantum NIKE, a key is deemed legitimate if the given Montgomery coefficient specifies a supersingular elliptic curve over the prime field. In this work, we survey the current supersingularity tests used for CSIDH key validation, and implement and measure two new alternative algorithms. Our implementation shows that we can determine supersingularity substantially faster, and using less memory, than the state-of-the-art.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={1}, journal={Mathematical Cryptology}, author={Banegas, Gustavo and Gilchrist, Valerie and Smith, Benjamin}, year={2022}, month={Oct.}, pages={21–35} }

abstract="Aggregating data from multiple sources is often required in multiple applications. In this paper, we introduce {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}DEVA{\}}{\$}{\$}DEVA, a protocol that allows a distributed set of servers to perform secure and verifiable aggregation of multiple users' secret data, while no communication between the users occurs. {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}DEVA{\}}{\$}{\$}DEVAcomputes the sum of the users' input and provides public verifiability, i.e., anyone can be convinced about the correctness of the aggregated sum computed from a threshold amount of servers. A direct application of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}DEVA{\}}{\$}{\$}DEVAprotocol is its employment in the machine learning setting, where the aggregation of multiple users' parameters (used in the learning model), can be orchestrated by multiple servers, contrary to centralized solutions that rely on a single server. We prove the security and verifiability of the proposed protocol and evaluate its performance for the execution time and bandwidth, the verification execution, the communication cost, and the total bandwidth usage of the protocol. We compare our findings to the prior work, concluding that {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}DEVA{\}}{\$}{\$}DEVArequires less communication cost for a big amount of users.",

The key space is not useful with previous algorithms, and the algorithm is not useful with previous key spaces, but combining the new key space with the new algorithm produces speed records for constant-time CSIDH. For example, for CSIDH-512 with a 256-bit key space, the best previous constant-time results used 789000 multiplications and more than 200 million Skylake cycles; this paper uses 438006 multiplications and 125.53 million cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={4}, journal={IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems}, author={Banegas, Gustavo and Bernstein, Daniel J. and Campos, Fabio and Chou, Tung and Lange, Tanja and Meyer, Michael and Smith, Benjamin and Sotáková, Jana}, year={2021}, month={Aug.}, pages={351–387} }
