Research in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has intensified 
significantly since 
\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization/call-for-proposals}
{the launch of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization project in 2016}. 
The development lifecycle of cryptographic schemes can be 
categorized into four key phases:

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.1pt}
\item \textbf{Mathematical Foundations}: Establishing the computational 
hardness of underlying mathematical problems through rigorous 
theoretical analysis;
\item \textbf{Scheme Construction}: Designing cryptographic primitives 
that utilize these mathematical foundations to create secure trapdoors 
functions;
\item \textbf{Algorithm Specification \& Prototyping}: Developing formal 
algorithm descriptions and reference implementations, culminating in 
standardized specifications;
\item \textbf{Deployment \& Integration}: Implementing production-ready 
solutions and fostering ecosystem adoption through standardization 
efforts.
\end{enumerate}
While many schemes, such as Kyber and Dilithium, have reached stages three or four, 
PQC research remains an active field. There are still numerous open problems and challenges, 
particularly following \href{https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/07/nist-announces-additional-digital-signature-candidates-pqc-standardization}
{NIST's announcement of new candidates for post-quantum signatures in 2023}. 
Additionally, enhancing efficiency and strengthening implementations against side-channel attacks (SCA) 
are ongoing priorities. It is also essential to adapt PQC to current applications, including communication protocols, 
hardware security modules (HSM), and various scenarios such as the Internet of 
Things (IoT) and vehicular communication.

In this research project, I will delineate the challenges that PQC confronts 
in terms of its security evaluation regarding its physical aspects. While presenting these challenges, 
I will put forth a proposal outlining strategies to address the evaluation of security and measurement of 
the countermeasures against side-channel attacks. 

\subsection*{Security Analysis of Post-Quantum Schemes}\label{sec:an}\vspace{-0.1cm}

Cryptosystems face vulnerabilities to SCA, wherein an adversary can deduce 
confidential information from physical observations, such as timing,
electromagnetic emanation, or power consumption, made during the execution of 
computations using sensitive data~\cite{brumley2005remote, 10.1007/3-540-48405-1_25}.
These attacks can be classified as passive, where the a
dversary simply observes leaked information without interfering, or active, 
where faults are intentionally injected to manipulate computations and extract 
secrets~\cite{4599557,6076462}. Both types pose serious threats and have been successfully employed 
across various applications, often proving challenging to detect.

Exploring SCA requires specialized equipment and training, as the 
methodologies and countermeasures are highly dependent on the targeted 
cryptosystem. While techniques exist to mitigate these attacks, many are 
intrinsic to specific schemes and lack easy adaptability to others. Consequently, 
securing each implementation demands a unique approach, necessitating 
expertise in both cryptographic engineering and side-channel analysis. 
Unfortunately, the pool of individuals capable of combining these
essential skills remains limited to a select group of professionals.

\subsubsection*{Methodology}

The proposed methodology comprises three 
interdependent phases designed to bridge gaps 
in hardware security and achieve practical implementation robustness:


\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, label=\textbf{\arabic*.}, series=main]
    \item \textbf{Systematic Vulnerability Analysis}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
        \item Investigation targets: NIST PQC candidates (\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions}{Round 4}, \href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig/round-2-additional-signatures}{Additional Call}), 
        \href{https://www.kpqc.or.kr/competition.html}{Korean PQC}, and \href{https://niccs.org.cn/en/notice/}{China PQC}.
        \item Attack methodologies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Passive}: Time analysis, and Differential power analysis (DPA)
            \item \textit{Active}: Clock and voltage glitching
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Countermeasure Design}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
        \item Algorithm-aware protection strategies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Masking: Implementing runtime techniques to obscure sensitive data and operations without compromising efficie;
            \item Fault tolerant operations: : Designing systems capable of maintaining functionality and security in the presence of induced faults.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Quantitative Security Benchmarking}

        \toprule
        \rowcolor{gray!40} % Darker header row
        \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Evaluation Methodology} \\
        \midrule
        Side-channel resistance & Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) with $t > 4.5$ threshold \\
         \midrule
        Computational overhead & Cycle count analysis vs. baseline specifications \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
    \end{center}
\end{enumerate}

More specifically, The methodology comprises the following steps:
(1) \textit{Attack surface enumeration} involves identifying targets, assessing potential 
side-channel vulnerabilities, and evaluating these targets 
using Husky and CW-Lite boards.
(2) \textit{Countermeasure prototyping} will be done by tailoring an algorithmic countermeasure to the 
attack and then it will be implemented in a software and hardware. 
(3) \textit{Validation} will involve implementing the software countermeasure on 
Cortex-M3 and M4 processors, and the hardware countermeasure on FPGAs, 
followed by testing on PolarFire and Xilinx platforms.

To achieve our objectives, we will need to acquire the materials 
listed in Table~\ref{tab:hardware_components}. Additionally, I 
plan to hire a PhD student to develop a framework for side-channel 
analysis and cryptographic hardware security.

%Fortunately, I have honed these skills throughout my career as a researcher and developed hardware 
%proficiency during my tenure at Qualcomm, a leading semiconductor design company. Additionally, I 
%possess knowledge of emerging threats to cryptography, including security analyses leveraging 
%quantum algorithms. Even with NIST moving to 
%\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions}{Round 4},
%\footnote{\url{https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/fvnhyQ25jUg/m/NJzYDqQBBAAJ}} current 
%submissions are still open to scrutiny, and may be subject to theoretical attacks (where one can break the entire 
%scheme) and side-channel attacks. The whole scientific community can propose attacks and/or improvements for 
%the submissions, to make the schemes more robust. I am therefore particularly interested in doing this.  
%Specifically, I am currently working on \textbf{evaluating security against side-channel attacks} and 
%\textbf{studying quantum algorithms}, to harden PQC algorithms.

The PhD student position is planned for a duration of three years, with a total 
salary of €75,000. Additionally, we have allocated 
€4,000 per year for the student to attend international 
conferences such as Eurocrypt and CHES, as well as summer schools. 
This brings the total estimated cost to €87,000.

Therefore, the total estimated cost for the PhD student is €87,000, 
and the overall project cost, including equipment, is €97,635.
