Research in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has been boosted since 
\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization/call-for-proposals}
{the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated its PQC standardization project in 2016}. 
The development of PQC schemes typically progresses through four stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.1pt}
\item \textbf{Mathematical Foundations}: Assessing the computational hardness of underlying mathematical problems;
\item \textbf{Scheme Construction}: Designing cryptographic schemes by leveraging these mathematical problems to create secure trapdoors;
\item \textbf{Algorithm and Prototype Development}: Developing algorithms and coding prototypes, leading to the release of specifications for standard algorithms;
\item \textbf{Deployment and Adoption}: Implementing and widely disseminating the cryptographic schemes.
\end{enumerate}
While many schemes, such as Kyber and Dilithium, have reached stages three or four, 
PQC research remains an active field. There are still numerous open problems and challenges, 
particularly following \href{https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/07/nist-announces-additional-digital-signature-candidates-pqc-standardization}
{NIST's announcement of new candidates for post-quantum signatures in 2023}. 
Additionally, enhancing efficiency and strengthening implementations against side-channel attacks (SCAs) 
are ongoing priorities. It is also essential to adapt PQC to current applications, including communication protocols, 
hardware security modules (HSMs), and various scenarios such as the Internet of 
Things (IoT) and vehicular communication.

In this research project, I will delineate the challenges that PQC confronts 
in terms of its security evaluation regarding its physical aspects. While presenting these challenges, 
I will put forth a proposal outlining strategies to address the evaluation of security and measurement of 
the countermeasures against side-channel attacks. 

\subsection*{Security Analysis of Post-Quantum Schemes}\label{sec:an}\vspace{-0.1cm}

Cryptosystems face vulnerabilities to SCA, wherein an adversary can deduce 
confidential information from physical observations, such as timing,
electromagnetic emanation, or power consumption, made during the execution of 
sensitive computations. These attacks can be classified as passive, where the a
dversary simply observes leaked information without interfering, or active, 
where faults are intentionally injected to manipulate computations and extract 
secrets. Both types pose serious threats and have been successfully employed 
across various applications, often proving challenging to detect.

Exploring SCA requires specialized equipment and training, as the 
methodologies and countermeasures are highly dependent on the targeted 
cryptosystem. While techniques exist to mitigate these attacks, many are 
intrinsic to specific schemes and lack easy adaptability to others. Consequently, 
securing each implementation demands a unique approach, necessitating 
expertise in both cryptographic engineering and side-channel analysis. 
Unfortunately, the pool of individuals capable of combining these
essential skills remains limited to a select group of professionals.


This research proposal focuses on the security evaluation of 
post-quantum digital signature schemes in the latest NIST 
call, with a particular emphasis on side-channel analysis. 
The primary objectives of this research are:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.1pt}
    \item \textbf{Evaluation of Side-Channel Attacks}: Analyzing vulnerabilities in selected signature schemes by applying both passive and active side-channel techniques, such as power analysis, fault injection, and electromagnetic analysis.
    \item \textbf{Design of Countermeasures}: Developing robust mitigation strategies tailored to each scheme, including masking, blinding, and fault detection mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking \& Validation}: Assessing the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasures by measuring their security, computational overhead, and feasibility for real-world deployment.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Impacts, Outcomes, and Ambitions}

The results of this research will contribute to the broader scientific community by:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.1pt}
    \item \textbf{Publications}: Targeting top-tier cryptography and security conferences/journals such as CHES, EUROCRYPT, CRYPTO, and IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security.
    \item \textbf{Conferences \& Collaborations}: Engaging with academic and industrial partners to disseminate findings, participate in research workshops, and enhance interdisciplinary knowledge exchange.
    \item \textbf{Industrial Impact}: Establishing connections with industry stakeholders, particularly in embedded security and hardware-based cryptographic implementations, to assess the practical adoption of countermeasures.
    \item \textbf{Funding Prospects}: This work is positioned to support funding applications through agencies such as the European Research Council (ERC), the French National Research Agency (ANR), and cybersecurity-focused industrial partnerships.
\end{itemize}

%Fortunately, I have honed these skills throughout my career as a researcher and developed hardware 
%proficiency during my tenure at Qualcomm, a leading semiconductor design company. Additionally, I 
%possess knowledge of emerging threats to cryptography, including security analyses leveraging 
%quantum algorithms. Even with NIST moving to 
%\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions}{Round 4},
%\footnote{\url{https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/fvnhyQ25jUg/m/NJzYDqQBBAAJ}} current 
%submissions are still open to scrutiny, and may be subject to theoretical attacks (where one can break the entire 
%scheme) and side-channel attacks. The whole scientific community can propose attacks and/or improvements for 
%the submissions, to make the schemes more robust. I am therefore particularly interested in doing this.  
%Specifically, I am currently working on \textbf{evaluating security against side-channel attacks} and 
%\textbf{studying quantum algorithms}, to harden PQC algorithms.


Producing new knowledge in this domain aligns with the objectives of the new cybersecurity 
master's program at École Polytechnique de Paris, which aims to equip students with advanced 
expertise in cryptographic security, hardware security, and side-channel analysis. By fostering 
research and innovation in these critical areas, the program contributes to the development of 
next-generation security professionals capable of addressing emerging threats in cryptography 
and beyond.
