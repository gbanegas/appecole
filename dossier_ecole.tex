Once a quantum computer capable of running Shor’s algorithm~\cite{365700} is built, 
currently deployed public-key cryptography \textbf{will be catastrophically and irreversibly broken}, 
exposing all past and future encrypted communications. In response, there is a global effort to 
develop cryptographic systems resistant to quantum attacks, known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). 
Research in PQC has intensified, particularly following 
\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization/call-for-proposals}
{the launch of the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization project in 2016}. 
However, participation in this project is global, and most countries follow its standards (including 
the Europe Union).

The development of cryptographic schemes follows a structured process: (1) It begins with the establishment of computational hardness assumptions through 
mathematical analysis, providing the theoretical foundation for security.
(2) These foundations enable the design of cryptographic primitives that leverage secure trapdoor functions, 
forming the basis of new encryption and signature schemes.
(3) Once the theoretical groundwork is laid, algorithms are formally specified and prototyped, leading to 
reference implementations. 
(4) The final stage involves integrating these solutions into real-world applications, ensuring their adoption 
through production-ready implementations.

While schemes like Kyber and Dilithium (two post-quantum schemes) have reached advanced stages, post-quantum cryptography 
remains an active research area with \emph{critical challenges}. Following \href{https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/07/nist-announces-additional-digital-signature-candidates-pqc-standardization}
{NIST's 2023 announcement of additional digital signature candidates}, 
improving efficiency and \textbf{hardening implementations against 
side-channel attacks (SCA)} have become \textbf{crucial}. As cryptographic schemes transition from 
theory to practice, their security in real-world deployments depends not only on their mathematical 
foundations but also on their resilience to physical attacks. Strengthening implementations against 
SCA is mandatory to preventing adversaries from extracting secret information through power analysis, 
electromagnetic leakage, or fault injection. This aspect of PQC is essential for secure adoption in 
applications such as hardware security modules, IoT devices, and vehicular communication—where 
attackers have physical access and SCA defenses are not optional but necessary. 

\emph{The goal of this project is to ensure cryptographic security beyond mathematical 
guarantees by evaluating and strengthening its resistance to physical attacks.}

\subsection*{Security Analysis of Post-Quantum Schemes}\label{sec:an}\vspace{-0.1cm}

Cryptosystems face vulnerabilities to SCA, wherein an adversary can deduce 
confidential information from physical observations, such as timing,
electromagnetic emanation, or power consumption, made during the execution of 
computations using sensitive data~\cite{brumley2005remote, KocherJJR11,10.1007/3-540-48405-1_25}.
These attacks can be classified as passive, where the a
dversary simply observes leaked information without interfering, or active, 
where faults are intentionally injected to manipulate computations and extract 
secrets~\cite{4599557,6076462}. Both types pose serious threats and have been successfully employed 
across various applications, often proving challenging to detect.

Exploring SCA requires specialized equipment and training, as the 
methodologies and countermeasures are highly dependent on the targeted 
cryptosystem. While techniques exist to mitigate these attacks, many are 
intrinsic to specific schemes and lack easy adaptability to others. Consequently, 
securing each implementation demands a unique approach, necessitating 
expertise in both cryptographic engineering and side-channel analysis. 
Unfortunately, the pool of individuals capable of combining these
essential skills remains limited to a select group of professionals.

\subsubsection*{Methodology}

The proposed methodology comprises three 
interdependent phases designed to bridge gaps 
in hardware security and achieve practical implementation robustness:


\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, label=\textbf{\arabic*.}, series=main]
    \item \textbf{Systematic Vulnerability Analysis}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
        \item Investigation targets: NIST PQC candidates (\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions}{Round 4}, \href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig/round-2-additional-signatures}{Additional Call}), 
        \href{https://www.kpqc.or.kr/competition.html}{Korean PQC}, and \href{https://niccs.org.cn/en/notice/}{China PQC}.
        \item Attack methodologies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Passive}: Time analysis, and Differential power analysis (DPA)
            \item \textit{Active}: Clock and voltage glitching
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Countermeasure Design}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
        \item Algorithm-aware protection strategies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Masking: Implementing runtime techniques to obscure sensitive data and operations without compromising efficie;
            \item Fault tolerant operations: : Designing systems capable of maintaining functionality and security in the presence of induced faults.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Quantitative Security Benchmarking}

    \end{center}
\end{enumerate}

More specifically, The methodology comprises the following steps:
(1) \textit{Attack surface enumeration} involves identifying targets, assessing potential 
side-channel vulnerabilities, and evaluating these targets 
using Husky and CW-Lite boards.
(2) \textit{Countermeasure prototyping} will be done by tailoring an algorithmic countermeasure to the 
attack and then it will be implemented in a software and hardware. 
(3) \textit{Validation} will involve implementing and measure the software countermeasure on 
Cortex-M3 and M4 processors, and the hardware countermeasure on FPGAs, 
followed by testing on PolarFire and Xilinx platforms.

To achieve our objectives, we will need to acquire the materials 
listed in Table~\ref{tab:hardware_components}. Additionally, I 
plan to hire a PhD student to develop a framework for side-channel 
analysis and cryptographic hardware security.

\subsection*{Impacts and Outcomes}

\paragraph{Impacts on \'Ecole Polytechnique de Paris.} 
Producing new knowledge in the hardware security domain aligns with the objectives of the cybersecurity 
program at \emph{École Polytechnique de Paris}, which aims to equip students with advanced 
expertise in cryptographic security, hardware security, and side-channel analysis. By fostering 
research and innovation in these critical areas, the program contributes to the development of 
next-generation security professionals capable of addressing emerging threats in cryptography 
and beyond.

\paragraph{Industrial Impact.} Establishing connections with industry, 
particularly in embedded security and hardware-based cryptographic 
implementations, to evaluate the practical adoption of countermeasures. 
My experience at \href{https://www.qualcomm.com/}{Qualcomm} provides a 
strong foundation for building future collaborations. Additionally, I 
have connections with professionals such as Matthieu Rivain and Sonia 
Belaïd from \href{https://www.cryptoexperts.com/people/}{CryptoExperts}, 
as well as Christine Cloostermans at 
\href{https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/smarter-world-blog/BL-EMBRACING-EQUITY-ON-EVERY-LEVEL}{NXP}, 
facilitating real-world feedback and further industrial partnerships.

\paragraph{Publications and scientific outcome.} Targeting top-tier cryptography and security conferences and journals such as 
\href{https://ches.iacr.org/index.php}{CHES}, \href{https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/}{EUROCRYPT}, 
\href{https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/}{ASIACRYPT}, 
\href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10206}{IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security}, 
and the \href{https://link.springer.com/journal/13389}{Journal of Cryptographic Engineering}. Moreover, other satellite 
conferences, such as \href{https://cascade-conference.org/cfp.html}{CASCADE}, also 
focus on related topics.

\paragraph{Scientific Collaborations.} Engaging in academic collaborations with international 
early-career researchers, including \href{https://mtrimoska.com/}{Monika Trimoska} (TU/e, Netherlands) and 
\href{https://www.sopmac.de/index.html}{Fábio Campos}(H-BRS, Germany), as well as continuing partnerships 
with other international researchers like \href{https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/chris-brzuska}{Chris Brzuska} (Aalto, Finland) 
and Łukasz Chmielewski (Masaryk University, Czech Republic). Additionally, initiating a project with local researcher Guénaël Renault. 
Participation in research workshops and summer schools, such as the 
\href{https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/}{Summer School on Real-World Cryptography and Privacy}, 
is also planned.

\paragraph{Funding Prospects.} The plan is to establish this project, 
set up the necessary equipment, consolidate the results, 
and then prepare an application for funding from the E
uropean Research Council (ERC) and the French National 
Research Agency (ANR). This proposal will also support the formation of 
a new group, Éclair, which originates from the former GRACE team.

%Fortunately, I have honed these skills throughout my career as a researcher and developed hardware 
%proficiency during my tenure at Qualcomm, a leading semiconductor design company. Additionally, I 
%possess knowledge of emerging threats to cryptography, including security analyses leveraging 
%quantum algorithms. Even with NIST moving to 
%\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions}{Round 4},
%\footnote{\url{https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/fvnhyQ25jUg/m/NJzYDqQBBAAJ}} current 
%submissions are still open to scrutiny, and may be subject to theoretical attacks (where one can break the entire 
%scheme) and side-channel attacks. The whole scientific community can propose attacks and/or improvements for 
%the submissions, to make the schemes more robust. I am therefore particularly interested in doing this.  
%Specifically, I am currently working on \textbf{evaluating security against side-channel attacks} and 
%\textbf{studying quantum algorithms}, to harden PQC algorithms.



\paragraph{Budget.}

Table \ref{tab:hardware_components} details the essential 
equipment required for comprehensive security evaluation of 
post-quantum cryptographic implementations. The hardware 
selection addresses three critical operational needs: 
(1) precise side-channel measurement capabilities, (2)
 target device programmability for various cryptographic schemes, 
 and (3) high-speed signal acquisition infrastructure.

The \emph{PhD student position} is planned for a duration of three years, with a total 
salary of €75,000. Additionally, we have allocated 
€4,000 per year for the student to attend international 
conferences such as Eurocrypt and CHES, as well as summer schools. 
This brings the total estimated cost to €87,000.

Regarding internship opportunities, we can host master's 
students for six-month projects. The main goal is to familiarize them 
with side-channel attacks through smaller projects, such as data 
acquisition and analysis or the implementation of countermeasures for 
cryptographic schemes. For such, X will be destinated 
to pay for the internship.


Therefore, the total estimated cost for the PhD student is €87,000,
the costs for internship is estimated in X, 
and the overall project cost, including equipment, is €97,635 + X. FIXME
