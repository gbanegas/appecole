With the advent of quantum computers capable of running Shor's 
algorithm~\cite{365700}, currently deployed public-key 
cryptography \textbf{will be catastrophically and irreversibly broken}, 
exposing all past and future encrypted communications. 
This risk has pushed a global initiative to develop cryptographic 
systems resistant to quantum attacks, known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). 
Research in PQC has intensified, particularly following 
\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization/call-for-proposals}
{the launch of the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization project in 2016}
and the ongoing call in 2023 of \href{https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/07/nist-announces-additional-digital-signature-candidates-pqc-standardization}
{NIST's additional digital signature candidates}.
However, participation in this project is global, and most countries follow its standards (including 
the European Union).

The development of cryptographic schemes follows a structured process: (1) It begins with the establishment of computational hardness assumptions through 
mathematical analysis, providing the theoretical foundation for security.
(2) These foundations enable the design of cryptographic primitives that leverage secure trapdoor functions, 
forming the basis of new encryption and signature schemes.
(3) Once the theoretical groundwork is laid, algorithms are formally specified and prototyped, leading to 
reference implementations. 
(4) The final stage involves integrating these solutions into real-world applications, ensuring their adoption 
through production-ready implementations.


The first international PQC standards were published last year
with \href{https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final}{ML-DSA} 
(signature scheme) and \href{https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final}{ML-KEM} 
(encryption scheme), 
however, post-quantum cryptography remains an 
active research area with \emph{critical challenges}. 
Improving efficiency and \textbf{hardening implementations against side-channel attacks (SCA)} 
have become \textbf{crucial}. As PQC transitions from theory to practice, 
its security in real-world deployments depends not 
only on its mathematical foundations but also on its 
resilience to physical attacks. Strengthening implementations against 
SCA is mandatory to prevent adversaries from extracting secret 
information through power analysis, electromagnetic leakage, or 
fault injection. This aspect of PQC is essential for secure adoption 
in applications such as hardware security modules, IoT devices, and 
vehicular communication---where attackers have physical access and 
SCA defenses are not optional but necessary.

\textbf{The goal of this project is to ensure cryptographic security beyond mathematical 
guarantees by evaluating and strengthening its resistance to physical attacks.}

\subsection*{Security Analysis of Post-Quantum Schemes}\label{sec:an}\vspace{-0.1cm}

Cryptosystems face vulnerabilities to SCA, wherein an adversary can deduce 
confidential information from physical observations--such as timing,
electromagnetic emanation, or power consumption--made during the execution of 
computations using sensitive data~\cite{brumley2005remote, KocherJJR11,10.1007/3-540-48405-1_25}.
These attacks can be classified as passive, where the a
dversary simply observes leaked information without interfering, or active, 
where faults are intentionally injected to manipulate computations and extract 
secrets~\cite{4599557,6076462}. Both types pose serious threats and have been successfully employed 
across various applications, often proving challenging to detect.

Exploring SCA requires specialized equipment and training, as the 
methodologies and countermeasures are highly dependent on the 
targeted cryptosystem. While techniques exist to mitigate these 
attacks, many are intrinsic to specific schemes and lack easy 
adaptability to others. Consequently, securing each implementation 
demands a unique approach, necessitating expertise in both 
cryptographic engineering and side-channel analysis. Unfortunately, 
the pool of individuals capable of combining these essential skills 
remains limited to a select group of professionals. Based on my experience in the 
security architecture industry, there is a 
clear shortage of professionals with the necessary expertise in this 
field. We aim to give a first step to develop the knowledge
and foundation for training students in hardware security.
\vspace{-0.5cm}


\paragraph{Methodology.} This project comprises three 
interdependent phases designed to bridge gaps 
in hardware security and achieve practical implementation robustness:


\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Enumerate Attack Surfaces and Analyze Vulnerabilities} 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em] 
\item Investigate cryptographic targets: 
\begin{itemize} \item USA NIST PQC candidates 
(\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions}{Round 4}, 
\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig/round-2-additional-signatures}{Additional Call}) 
\item \href{https://www.kpqc.or.kr/competition.html}{Korean PQC} 
\item \href{https://niccs.org.cn/en/notice/}{China PQC} 
\end{itemize} 
\item Assess vulnerabilities using Husky and CW-Lite boards; 
\item Execute attack: 
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item \textit{Passive}: Perform time analysis and Differential Power Analysis (DPA) 
    \item \textit{Active}: Apply clock/voltage glitching 
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Prototype Adaptive Countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item Develop algorithm-aware protection strategies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement masking techniques to obscure sensitive data without efficiency loss
        \item Design fault-tolerant operations to resist induced faults
    \end{itemize}
    \item Deploy countermeasures across platforms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integrate software protections on embedded systems (Cortex-M4/M3)
        \item Implement hardware mitigations in FPGA architectures
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Validate Implementations and Benchmark Security}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item Test software countermeasures on Cortex-M3/M4 processors
    \item Verify hardware countermeasures using PolarFire and Xilinx FPGAs
    \item Quantify security improvements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Measure side-channel resistance: Practical approach and Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA)
        \item Assess computational overhead: Cycle count analysis vs. baseline specifications
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The research \textbf{fills a significant gap}, as LIX does not yet have 
the materials nor the expertise in hardware security. 
Validation is crucial to ensure that the developed countermeasures 
are both practical and effective. The project will be strengthened by 
leveraging my industrial experience and collaborations. 
A PhD student will be hired to work on side-channel analysis and 
cryptographic hardware security, contributing across all three 
research areas: (1) identifying vulnerabilities, (2) designing and 
implementing countermeasures, and (3) validating security 
enhancements.

cryptographic security, hardware security, and side-channel analysis. 
By fostering research and innovation in these critical areas, 
it contributes to the development of next-generation security 
professionals capable of addressing emerging threats in 
cryptography and beyond. Given the strong demand for expertise 
in this field, this initiative will play a crucial role in knowledge 
dissemination, training, and academic collaborations. Moreover, the 
project will be carried out within the new research team \'Eclair, 
where early support will help build a base for further developments, 
including lab projects and contributions to the Cybersecurity 
Master's program.

%Fortunately, I have honed these skills throughout my career as a researcher and developed hardware 
%proficiency during my tenure at Qualcomm, a leading semiconductor design company. Additionally, I 
%possess knowledge of emerging threats to cryptography, including security analyses leveraging 
%quantum algorithms. Even with NIST moving to 
%\href{https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions}{Round 4},
%\footnote{\url{https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/fvnhyQ25jUg/m/NJzYDqQBBAAJ}} current 
%submissions are still open to scrutiny, and may be subject to theoretical attacks (where one can break the entire 
%scheme) and side-channel attacks. The whole scientific community can propose attacks and/or improvements for 
%the submissions, to make the schemes more robust. I am therefore particularly interested in doing this.  
%Specifically, I am currently working on \textbf{evaluating security against side-channel attacks} and 
%\textbf{studying quantum algorithms}, to harden PQC algorithms.
