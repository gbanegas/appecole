The key space is not useful with previous algorithms, and the algorithm is not useful with previous key spaces, but combining the new key space with the new algorithm produces speed records for constant-time CSIDH. For example, for CSIDH-512 with a 256-bit key space, the best previous constant-time results used 789000 multiplications and more than 200 million Skylake cycles; this paper uses 438006 multiplications and 125.53 million cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={4}, journal={IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems}, author={Banegas, Gustavo and Bernstein, Daniel J. and Campos, Fabio and Chou, Tung and Lange, Tanja and Meyer, Michael and Smith, Benjamin and Sotáková, Jana}, year={2021}, month={Aug.}, pages={351–387} }
